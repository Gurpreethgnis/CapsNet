# CapsNet or Capsule Networks

Sabour et al. 2017: "A capsule is a group of neurons whose activity vector represents the instantiation parameters of a specific type of entity such as an object or object part."

Capsule Networks are made of these capsules that offers the state-of-the-art performance for MNIST character recognition dataset. They are an improvement to the convolutional neural network because of the two following reasons

1.  They understand the spatial relationships between the set of featurer whereas in the case of convoutional neural networks while subsampling/ pooling this information is lost.
2.  They are more robust to the geometric transformations of the learned features such as rotation, translation etc. Hence these are more generalisable.
